# Employee Tracker
This app is for the busy business owner who needs to efficiently view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so they can organize their business appropriately. An owner isn't going to be manipulating table records in a database directly, so the need to be able to access information through a content management system (CMS), the Employee Tracker app. 

The Employee Tracker is an interface allowing non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in their employee database. This is a command-line application that allows for management of a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js installed locally to install packages to and from the public npm registry. [Node.js installation documentation.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
Required when when you first set up the project for local development or use OR if any changes are made to the project's dependencies. [More Node information here.](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/)

## Usage
Run this application by:
1. Cloning the repository to your local machine.

2. Once in the root folder in your command line interface, start the application by entering `node index.js`

If you make any changes to the database schema or seed data: 
1. update your mysql shell from the db folder in your terminal with `mysql -u root -p`

3. `source schema.sql` to use the updated schema.

4. `source seeds.sql` to use the updated seed data file.

5. `quit` to exit your mysql shell. At this point the application is ready to be started in your CLI again.
